GSE1 = input("Atleast 3 CH4 GSE Tanks and 3 LOX GSE Tanks, along with a single Nitrogen GSE tank and a Water tank made out of the 12m wide Cryo Shells, speaking of cryo shells..")
Cryoshells = input("7 Cryogenic Shells will be needed, they will be 12 meters wide and slightly taller then the GSE tanks and act as an insulation sheild to prevent fuel boiling off. The exception is the Water GSE tank as it won't need it and it is made out of a Shell.")
Launchpad1 = input("The Orbital Table needs to be rolled out to the launch pad and stacked on the Support structure. Plumbing to transport the fuel from the GSE tanks to fuel SN20 and BN3, Water for the sound suppression, electrical plumbing to power up the Rocket and a flame diverter.")
Launchpad2 = input("Right next to the table is the launch tower, whitch will be 142 meters tall. Each section needs to be built and stacked individually. They will need to also extend their crane to stack the top of the tower, and also Build a crane ontop of the tower to stack Starship onto Superheavy.")
Raptors1 = input("The Raptor Engines are the most important and expensive part of Starship. For the first flight test, SN20 will have 3 Sea Level Raptors and BN3 will have 29 Sea Level Raptors. The reason SN20 will have no Vacuum Raptors is that they are still in development and are not ready to be flown.")
Raptors2 = input("Based on info from Elon Musk, it currently takes around 48 hours to produce one raptor. If they still are using the current design that has flown on SN15, then they may have up to 20 ready. This is only speculation, so don't take this as facts.")
BN3 = input("BN3 is currenlty being stacked in the high bay. The vehicle is around 15 rings tall.")
SN20 = input("SN20 is presumably being stacked in the Mid-Bay, prior to being rolled out to the High-Bay for Flap and Nose Cone installation.")
standardnoseconestacking = input("SN20 will likely differ from SN8-11 and SN15+16. Normally, the Nosecone is assembled and then stacked ontop of the Nosecone barrel section, followed by installation of the two FWD flaps.")
standardtankstacking1 = input("With the tank section, the rings are built in the one of the three production tents. The After dome is stacked onto the engine section and header tank plumbing is installed. The rings designated to have heat sheild tiles are also bolted on with tiles. Once stacking in the midbay is finished, the tank section, in the case of SN8-11 and SN16, is rolled to the Highbay where the Flaps and nosecone is installed, but in the case of SN15. it was rolled out of the Midbay and imedeately had it's Aft Flaps installed.")
SN20tiles = input("How SN20 will differ may be as follows: After stacking, it will likely be rolled into the midbay and have all it's tiles installed, the same goes for the Tank section and Aft flaps except in the Midbay.")
Rollout1 = input("At this rate, it's likely BN3 will be stacked first. If it is, it will roll out to the Orbital launch site and be placed ontop of the OLT. After it is secured, [And do note BN3 will be atleast 70 meters tall] Probably the second most tedious part of SN20/BN3 is the installation of all 29 Raptor engines. [FYI: The most ever fired at once if 3]")
Rollout2 = input("All 8 GSE tanks will be needed to be fueled at this point. BN3 will preform a Cryogenic Nitrogen test, where they fully fuel the vehicle with liquid nitrogen. This will likely last several hours. A few days after the Cryo Test, or maybe even a day later, BN3 will have to ignite the most amount of rocket engines at once for more than 50 years. All 29 Raptors ignite for atleast 3-5 seconds, all of them need to work for flight.")
Rollout3 = input("After BN3's ground testing, SN20, with all of it's heat sheild tiles will rollout to Sub-Orbital pad A or B, where it has it's 3 raptors installed and preforms a cryo-test and a static fire. Following static fires, SN20 is unmounted from the Sub-Orbital pad and rolled over to the OLP, where the Tower's crane will secure SN20 and carefully raise it onto BN3. This is alot more complicated then Stacking a starship's nosecone or securing onto the launch pad. If it isn't secured properly, it might actually 'fall off' BN3 and be destroyed along with the booster.")
Rollout4 = input("After stacking, both BN3 and SN20 preform a cryo test. Following cryo test, BN3 preforms a final static fire. After all preps, the vehicle is ready for launch.")

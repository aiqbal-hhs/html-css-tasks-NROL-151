<p> In order to make a shuttle derived vehicle, we need to know the components of the shuttle that would help mamking a SDLV.</p>
<h3>SHUTTLE DERRIVED HARDWARE</h3>
<p>Shuttle Solid Rocket Motor</p>
<p>RS-25D/E Engine</p>
<p>Hydrolox Fuel Tanks</p>
<p>Shuttle OMS/OMS Motors</p>
<p>Shuttle Launch Tower</p>
<h3>SIMILIAR SHUTTLE LIKE HARDWARE</h3>
<p>RS-68A Engine</p>
<p>RL-10 Engine</p>
<p>Orion Capsule</p>
<p>Delta Cryogenic Second Stage</p>
<p>Nuclear Propulsion</p>
<p>Methalox Fuel Cycle</p>
<h3>WHAT WE COULD MAKE</h3>
<h4>SHLV</h4>
<p> A Launch vehicle with a core stage very similiar to SLS, with the only difference really being an aditional RS-25 engine in the middle. The Vehicle could have 2 or 4 Shuttle Boosters Either being 4 or 5 segment boosters. The Upper stage would be a cryogenic stage with 1,2 or 4 RL-10 engines. A third stage powered by a single RL-10 engine would be optional, and the fairing would be 10 meters tall. Similiar to ULA's Vulcan rocket, the engine section of the core would be jetisoned after the core seperates and inflates a heatshield to control itself and protect the engines. After slowing down enough, it deploys a parachute and is recovered by a large boat for reuse of the engines.</p>
<h4> CTV </h4>
<p> A smaller launch vehicle similiar to the Atlas V or Falcon-9 would carry and Orion Crew Capsule for Low Earth Orbit Missions. The First Stage would be fueled by Methalox and would use 5 engines. The First stage would have fins on the interstage and landing legs to propolsively land next to the launch pad. The Second Stage would use 2 RL-10 engines and carry Orion to orbit for possible LEO and ISS Missions.</p>
<h4>RTV</h4>
<p> A launch vehicle about 1/3rd to 1/5th taller then the CTV with a first stage very similiar to that of the CTV's first stage, except it doesn't have recovery hardware and has large fins at the bottom. The second stage would be a slightly smaller version of the optional third stage on the SHLV, but with more control systems. finally, there would be a spaceplane similiar in size to the space shuttle but with an abort system, a nose docking port and radiators and solar pannels on the outside.</p>
<h4>RS-25X</h4>
<p>The RS-25X would be a highly modified version of the RS-25 that had many advantages. The RS-25X would take only 2 or even 1 seconds to ignite, in comparison, the current RS-25 takes several seconds to light up. Another advantage would be that the RS-25X would be easily restartable and could ignite 50 times before it would either have to have major repairs or be scrapped. another major advantage would be that the RS-25X could throttle down to as low as %20 of thrust, while the current RS-25 engine can only throttle down to %69 of thrust. Nice.</p>
<h3>POTENTIAL USES</h3>
<h4> LUNAR </h4>
<p> Similiar to the cancelled Constellation Project, SHLV would lift a reusable version of the third stage and an expendable descent stage. A Second launch would carry use the CTV to lift a reusable Ascent stage to dock with the Descent stage within 24 hours after launch. Thirdly, an SHLV would deliver a science lab and lunar rover to the surface of the moon at the planned landing site. Lastly. a CTV would lift an Orion into orbit to dock with the Lunar lander. The transfer stage then boosts the payload to the moon. After then, the spacecraft coasts to the moon and the tug circularizes around the moon before undocking and makes it's way into a high Earth orbit to be refuelled for the next mission. The lander then undocks and lands on the moon. After a few days on the moon, the ascent stage lifts off from the moon and docks with Orion, unloads the crew and samples and then is disposed of for the first mission or two, but after that the Ascent stage would be refuelled and put itself into low earth orbit. Orion would then depart the moon and return to Earth.</p>
<h4> MARS MISSION </h4>
<p> Firstly, a SHLV would launch a lander to the surface of Mars, the lander would be uncrewed and would have a science lab and rover, similiar to the Lunar mission, only made to survive the Martian conditions. Then, a SHLV would launch a reusable Mars Ascent Descent Crew Transportation (MADCTV) into low Earth orbit. the vehicle would have deployable and retractable Solar Pannels on one side and radiators on the other side. The vehicle would also be designed to be aerodynamically stable during Entry and Descent, when the vehicle was about 2 Kilometers in altitude, it would lite 1,2 or 3 RS-25X The vehicle would have vernier thrusters for roll control if it was preforming a single engine landing The vehicle would be designed to be able to land on Mars, unload cargo and crew, refuel itself and return directly back to Earth, but it would be launched without fuel and only fuel for it's reaction control system. Following deployment, the MADCTV, nicknamed "Journey-I" would deploy its solar pannels and orient itself so that the solar pannels always face the sun and the radiators always face away from the sun during its LEO stay. The very next day, a second SHLV would launch a LH2 (Hydrodgen) fuel tank that would dock behind Journey-I and fuel it's Hydrodgen tanks. After the fueling process was complete, the Hydrodgen tank was ditched and deorbited, followed by up to 4 or more tanker launches to fuel the hydrodgen tanks. Following the Hydrodgen tanks fully fueled on Journey-I, a modified tanker would send up the LO2 (Liquid Oxygen) to fuel up the rest of Journey-I. after a week long campaign, a CTV would launch the first crew batch, with the second following up on a RTV that would also deliver science payloads to be used at Mars. After the Crew, payload and spacecraft were all ready, the RTV would undock and Autonomously return to Earth, Journey-I would then ignite it's 4 RL-10 engines and make the burn to Mars. Following a long journey in space, the solar pannels and radiators would retract and the vehicle would orient itself for an Aerobrake around mars, capturing itself into a high Mars orbit. Journey-I would then coast to it's Apogee and then come in for a second Aerobrake and target it's landing site, Jezro Crater. Following a succesful Entry and Descent, Journey-I, on course towards it's targeted landing site would flip vertical and ignite one, then three RS-25X engines and slow down towards the surface. Once it slows down enough and is low enough, it shuts off the two outside engines and deploys 4 Large landing legs and lands on Mars, with fumes remaining in the fuel tank. after a long multi month stay, the crew would board Journey, refuel and begin a direct return to Earth for a propulsive landing at the same site it launched from on Earth.</p>
<h4>LUNAR BASE</h4>
<p>A SHLV would launch 40 Lunar Communication Sattelites into orbit of the moon, each able to communicate with each other, the Moon and back to Earth. Then, a SHLV in it's most powerful configuration would launch a solar pannel farm to the designated colony area, 2 Science modules and 2 Habitat modules that would land a few meters apart and if need be, preform a short hop to arrive at the designated location. Following the delivery of the basic habitat, a Rover and Greenhouse would be delivered in the center of the landing site, the rover would then move the science labs and habitats into the desired location. A small space station consisting of 4 modules (A Power Module, A habitat, docking port and robotic arm) would be assembled in LEO using RTV's and would boost itself to the Moon, where a fully reusable RL-10 powered lander with an ejectable cabin with a heat sheild and parachutes incase of a need for a direct return to Earth would arrive to the station for crew transport to the surface. Finally, several science experiments, mobile antennas, drills, cargo pallets and of course, the crew, would be delivered.</p>
